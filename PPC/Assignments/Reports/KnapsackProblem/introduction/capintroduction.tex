\chapter{Introduction} \label{cap:intro}

This report presents the implementation and analysis of parallel approaches to
solving the Knapsack Problem using Genetic Algorithms in Java. The assignment
evaluates understanding of Java's threading model, thread lifecycle, and
synchronization primitives.

\section{Problem Context}

The Knapsack Problem is a fundamental optimization problem in computer science.
Due to the exponential computational cost of evaluating all possible item
combinations, heuristic methods like Genetic Algorithms are often employed to
find near-optimal solutions efficiently.

\section{Objectives}

The primary objective is to explore different parallelization strategies to
improve performance. Key areas for parallelization
include fitness evaluation, genetic operations, and population management.
