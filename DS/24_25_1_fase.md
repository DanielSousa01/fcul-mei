## 1. Evaluating whether a software system has a “good” design involves measurable indicators and principles that provide objective criteria for assessment.

### (a) What measurable indicators can be used to evaluate if a software design is "good"?

The measurable indicators that can be used to evaluate if a software design is "good" include:

- **Halstead Volume**: This metric mesures the size of the code on the number of operators and operands, estimating the cognitive effort needed to understand the code.
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: This indicates the number of linearly independent paths through the code, reflecting its logical complexity and potential for errors.
- **Maintainability Index**: A composite metric that assesses how easy it is to maintain the code, factoring in cyclomatic complexity.
- **Information Flow Complexity**: Measures the complexity based on the flow of information between modules, considering how data is passed through the system.
- **Metrics for OO Design**: 
  - **Weighted Methods per Class (WMC)**: Sums the complexity of all methods in a class, indicating the class's complexity.
  - **Depth of Inheritance Tree (DIT)**: Measures how far a class is from the root of the inheritance tree, indicating potential reuse and complexity.
  - **Response For a Class (RFC)**: Counts the number of methods that can be executed in response to a message received by a class, showing its potential interaction complexity.
  - **Number of Children (NOC)**: Tracks how many subclasses inherit from a class, indicating its inheritance hierarchy depth.


### (b) How do software design principles, such as separation of concerns or abstraction, contribute to assessing design quality?

Design principles improve quality by shaping structural properties that can be measured. **Separation of Concerns** increases cohesion and reduces coupling, making modules easier to understand, change, and test, which typically lowers interaction complexity and stabilizes dependencies. **Abstraction and DRY** hide implementation details and eliminate duplication, reducing per‑method and per‑class complexity and improving reuse. These principles lead to designs that are more modular, maintainable, and adaptable, which can be quantitatively assessed using the aforementioned metrics.

## 2. Performance is a critical quality attribute in software systems.

### (a) Explain what it consists of.

The performance of a software consists in how efficiently it utilizes the system resources to provide timely responses to any requests. It is often measured in terms of response time, throughput, and resource utilization. Performance is crucial for ensuring that the system can handle the expected load and provide a satisfactory user experience.

### (b) In general, requirements for different quality attributes often conflict with one another. Provide an example of a software system that illustrates potential conflicts between performance and other quality attribute.

An example of a software conflict is related, for example, performance and security. This conflict is evident in systems that require encryption for data transmission. While encryption enhances security by protecting data from unauthorized access, it also introduces additional processing overhead, which can lead to increased response times and reduced throughput. As a result, the system may struggle to meet performance requirements while ensuring data security.

### (c) Consider a system with two independent servers:

- Server1: Availability 𝑎1, service rate 𝑠1
- Server2: Availability 𝑎2, service rate 𝑠2, where 𝑠1 > 𝑠2.

Requests are distributed between the two servers based on their availability and the
presented service rates, using a load-balacing strategy:

1) If both are available, requests are routed to the faster server,
2) If only one is available, it handles the requests.

Considering only situations where a response is obtained, calculate the average response time for the system based on the given parameters.

To calculate the average response time for the system, we need to consider the different scenarios based on the availability of the servers.

1. Both servers are available:
   - Probability: 𝑎1 * 𝑎2
   - Response time: 1/𝑠1 (since requests are routed to the faster server)
2. Only Server1 is available:
    - Probability: 𝑎1 * (1 - 𝑎2) 
    - Response time: 1/𝑠1
3. Only Server2 is available:
    - Probability: (1 - 𝑎1) * 𝑎2
    - Response time: 1/𝑠2
     
The average response time (ART) can be calculated as follows:
ART = (𝑎1 * 𝑎2 * (1/𝑠1)) + (𝑎1 * (1 - 𝑎2) * (1/𝑠1)) + ((1 - 𝑎1) * 𝑎2 * (1/𝑠2)) / (𝑎1 + 𝑎2 - 𝑎1 * 𝑎2)

# Group II

SmartSuggest is an e-commerce recommendation system that aims to provide personalized product recommendations to users based on their browsing and purchasing behavior. The system collects real-time user activity data (e.g., product views, clicks, and purchases). It must generate personalized recommendations for each active user in near real-time and periodically produce global trending product lists (daily, weekly, monthly). The recommendations must prioritize performance and scalability to handle thousands of users. The system must allow easy updates to recommendation algorithms and support integration with external analytics tools.

## 1. Choose an architectural style suitable for this system.

### (a) Suggest an architectural style suitable for this system, considering the need for scalability and independent deployment of services. Describe, in abstract terms, the types of components and connectors used. Explain the key advantages and disadvantages of the identified style.

### (b) Design an architecture for the system based on the chosen style. Present a component and connector view illustrating the system's runtime organization. Include a legend and describe all the elements in the diagram, clarifying their roles and responsibilities.

---

## 2. Why is it essential to use multiple architectural views to document a system like SmartSuggest? Provide examples of views that would be relevant and explain their purpose.

---

## 3. Imagine the module responsible for product recommendations needs to be outsourced to an external vendor. What are the advantages of using the architecture identified in 1 (a) compared to other tightly coupled architectures?

---

# Group III

## 1. It is well known that a system's architecture strongly influences different quality attributes.

### (a) Explain the typical structure of a quality scenario and discuss the advantages of using these scenarios to express requirements related to quality attributes.

### (b) Write two quality scenarios for SmartSuggest: one addressing modifiability and another addressing response time. Explicitly state, if relevant, the expected system load or rate of incoming user activity data.

### (c) Assuming the solution does not meet the response time requirements specified in (b), would it make sense to consider some form of prioritization of events?

# Group IV

## 1. Suppose you need to implement a custom rule engine for generating product recommendations in SmartSuggest. Would it make sense to use a DSL for this purpose? Justify your answer and indicate whether an internal or external DSL would be more appropriate.

---

## 2. SmartSuggest can be envisioned as a Software Product Line capable of supporting various configurations tailored to different customer needs. Every SmartSuggest system must include ingestion of user activity, recommendation generation and result presentation. Data ingestion can support real-time processing, batch processing or both. The recommendation types can be personalized or global trending lists, showing popular products system, with the option to combine both. The recommendation algorithms can be rule-based, relying on predefined business rules, ML-based, using machine-learning models or a hybrid approach combining both. Finally, result presentation can be done via web interfaces, mobile apps or APIs. These variability points have dependencies; for example, personalized recommendations require real-time ingestion.

### (a) Create a feature diagram representing the variability points described in SmartSuggest. Ensure it includes mandatory and optional features, as well as dependencies between them.

### (b) What are the advantages of managing SmartSuggest as a Software Product Line instead of developing independent systems for each configuration?
